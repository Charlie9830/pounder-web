            Firstly an Important note. Handball syncs and backs up it's data using
            Google Cloud Platform. Above a certain usage this service is no longer
            free. Whilst we are in the test phase,
            please only provide this app to those you are directly working with,
            and instruct them not to pass it on to others. If the servers get close to
            hitting the allowed free quota, I will have to start disabling accounts I do
            not recognize.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks for agreeing to give Handball a test drive.
            Over on the left (or the top if you are on Mobile)
            you will find the Help and Overview tabs to help you
            get started. If you would like to learn more read on.
            Otherwise feel free to close this and dive right in.

        <h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
        <p>
            Handball is a dashboard based Todo list application. It was designed to provide much of the same functionality as 
            other todo list applications whilst providing a quicker and easier way to classify todo items. Handball is supported
            on iOS and Android, but it's focus is on the desktop, compatiable with both Windows and MacOS, the extra screen real
            estate provided by laptops and desktops really play to the strengths of Handball.

        <h3 id="how-do-i-get-the-mobile-app"> How do I get the Mobile App? </h3>
        <p>
            The mobile companion App is packaged as a "Progressive Web App".
            This is a relatively new technology that enables users to download
            websites onto their phones which act as if they are Native mobile apps
            complete with home screen Icon, Offline support etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can download the App by opening your mobile device's browser and
            navigating to:
        </p>
        <p>
            https://pounder-production2.firebaseapp.com/
        </p>
        <h4>
             Android Install
        </h4>
        <p>
            Using Chrome works best. Navigate to the URL above. Once loaded you will be prompted
            to add Handball to your Home screen. If you are not prompted automatically,
            you can touch the menu in the top right hand corner and select "Add to Homescreen".
        </p>
        <h4>
            iOS Install
        </h4>
        <p>
            I reccomend using Safari with iOS version 11.3 or later.
            Navigate to the URL above. Once the page has loaded click the Share icon 
            on the Safari Toolbar, select Add to Homescreen.
        </p>
        <p>
            iOS places many more restrictions on Progressive Web Apps then Android does.
            Read more about those restrictions here.

            <h4> Todo Apps </h4>
            <p>
                Handball started as a passion project to solve some
                problems I was having with a lot of the existing Todo
                list applications. Generally speaking, I found these apps
                would generally fall short when they were really pushed.
                My number one gripe was that it was always very difficult to
                class each todo into a context. For example, I noticed many
                users appending suffixes to their Todo items in order to class 
                them as contexts such as "Refocusing", "Set Electrics" etc.
                Some apps had support for moving Todo items between lists, but
                often this process was clumsy and slow.
            </p>
            <h4> Poor desktop support </h4>
            <p>
                My second gripe with the existing apps is even though the
                app may support mulitple Lists or Contexts, you often couldn't view
                these on the same page, even when using the app is running on a
                computer. This is understandable, as the target audience of those apps
                is Mobile users.
            </p>
            <h4> Project managment apps </h4>
            <p>
                Stepping into the realm of Project management software, although desktop
                support is much better, these applications are in a sense to restrictive
                for everyday use. They are often designed for managing large teams with tasks that
                can often take days or weeks to complete and require progess tracking.
                I found these apps to be too inflexiable and not fast enough to keep up with day to 
                day tasks. I don't need to track the progress of refilling some haze machines.. I just
                need to remember to do it.
            </p>

        <h3 id="whats-wrong-with-using-a-notepad"> What's wrong with using a Notepad?</h3>
            <p>
                I often used just a notepad to keep track of tasks. But during every transfer, there was
                always a point where the notepad would go missing and the first job of the day would be to
                hunt it down. I also found myself writing a lot of stuff on the back of my hand or in a note
                on my phone to transfer onto the notepad when I was back in front it.
            </p>

        <h3 id="where-is-my-data-stored"> Where is my Data stored? </h3>
            <p>
                Handball on desktop stores it's data in 3 locations. Servers, internal database and backup files.
                Any change you make is automatically stored on the device you are on, if you have an active internet
                connection it will be synced to the servers, if not, it will wait until it has a stable connection again.
                If you close the app whilst offline you will not loose any data. There is also a backup system implemented
                that stores backups of your data to your own hard disk. These are stored in you user folder under "Handball".
                You can use these to restore your projects if something goes horribly wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Handball on mobile stores it's data in 2 locations, Servers and internal database. On Android you can use
                Handball without an internet connection. The app will automatically sync the changes you have made once you
                reconnect to the internet.
                Currently on iOS this is not cleanly supported. Please see +++++++++++++++++ for more info on this.
            </p>

        <h3 id="ios-limitations">
            iOS Limitations
        </h3>
        <p>
            Handball is built on the Progress Web App platform. Although this new standard is fully supported on Android devices.
            Apple has been very slow on the up take. They are making steps in the right direction, but these are slow.
            There are two key limitations that affect Handball.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                No background sync. If you make changes offline they won't be automatically synced to the server
                when you regain a connection. You have to manually open the app and give it a few momments to sync.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you don't use the app for a few weeks, the app's contents will be deleted. The icon will remain but the app will
                need to be re-downloaded next time it is opened.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="why-is-it-called-handball"> Why is it called Handball? </h3>
        <p>
            So when you need to tell someone to put it on the list you can say "Can you handball that"
        </p>
        <h3 id="whats-next"> What's next? </h3>
        <p>
            Handball originally started as an app just for myself. But after 10 months of working on it
            in my spare time I now feel like it has enough features that it can help other people.
            This intial test stage has a few goals.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Determine if other people find use in the app. </li>
            <li> Determine which new features users would like to see. </li>
            <li> Determine if users would be interested in some form of donation to 
                cover the costs of the servers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="possible-future-monetization">
            Possible Future Monetization
        </h4>
        <p>
            If Handball finds a home on more than a few users computers and mobile devices,
            I will begin to exceed the free server quota that Handball relies on. In order to
            keep Handball running I will have to find some sort of monetization system.
            I am a strong beleiver in the principles of Free Open Source Software, with this in mind
            I feel that a donation model would be the best approach. However staying transparent
            will be a challenge. For now, whilst you use Handball, I ask you to keep this question in back of
            your mind "Would you be willing to donate a few dollars a month in order to upkeep the servers".
